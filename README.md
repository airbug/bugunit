bugunit
=======

Ways to run the tests
- npm test (include the bugunit-run.js script which is run using node)
- bugunit [test name (optional)]
- buildbug (bugunit is integrated with buildbug, so you can enable the package and run the tests from your build bug script)
- programmatically using the buildbug module (this is how buildbug integrates)
